## Vendor Modules

A vendor module allows you to control targeting, slot ids, and run time behavior of an Ad. Examples of vendor modules that ship with AdJS are Krux or Admantix. As vendor modules can potentially be dangerous, you should ensure you only implement modules from trusted sources or roll them in-house.
