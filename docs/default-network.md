# Default Network
The default provider in Ad.js is what most providers inherit from. At its core it is an interface of noops (link). Use the default provider while youâ€™re in development mode or on an environment that should not make requests to your actual ad platform.

## Arguments
No arguments are required for the default network.

## Additional Options
The default network does not add any configuration options to Ad Options.

## Examples

```js
    const bucket = new AdJS.Bucket({
      network: AdJS.Networks.Default,
    });
```
